# Jonas' Complete Node.js, Express and MongoDB Bootcamp Course

[course slides available for download](theory-lectures.pdf)

Use starter code to start each section, and **final code to compare it with your own code whenever something doesn't work**!

Plus, I made all the [course slides available for download](theory-lectures.pdf), to make it easier to follow along the theory videos.

Installation for mongodb is different from tutorial videos.

1. cd /Users
2. cd to your home directory
3. mkdir data
4. cd data
5. mkdir db
6. mongod --dbpath ~/data/db press enter then just keep it running
